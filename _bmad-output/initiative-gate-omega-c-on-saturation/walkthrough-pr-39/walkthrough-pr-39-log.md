# Review log: PR #39

Target: https://github.com/zhmachenkov-d/ha-smart-hvac/pull/39 (`refactor/1-5-omega-c-sweep` @ 15c23bb)

## 1 — orientation — started

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T05:37:36+03:00

- Action: Orientation; user confirmed target PR #39 (story 1.5 Refactor sweep).
- Result: Target locked; focus = companion sync + naming/helper sweep, no intentional behavior change.
- Evidence: PR #39; story-refactor-sweep-plan.md frozen Intent; commit 15c23bb
- Open: Draft narrative

## 2 — narrative — drafted

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T05:38:00+03:00

- Action: Wrote full narrative blocks (Intent verbatim from plan; Broad strokes; Companion sync; rename+helper; post-write+tests; Periphery).
- Result: Current block Intent in progress; awaiting human review moves.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-39.md; plan frozen Intent
- Open: none

## 3 — Intent — Thoughts

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T05:39:00+03:00

- Action: Compared frozen Intent to CAP-2/CAP-4 companions, flowchart, deferred-work, and control_tick (should_apply_omega_c, track_and_guard, apply_proposed, sticky after write).
- Result: Intent matches shipped scope; companions/deferred cleared; rename+helper+post-write apply_proposed present; latch_out left; no Intent gaps. Soft note only if any — parent will say.
- Evidence: story-refactor-sweep-plan.md Intent; control-tick-behaviors CAP-2/4; architecture-diagrams; hvac_app.py; deferred-work.md
- Open: await user done/next on Intent

## 4 — Intent — done

- Open: await user done/next on Companion sync
