# Review log: PR #34

Target: https://github.com/zhmachenkov-d/ha-smart-hvac/pull/34 (`feat/1-2-latch-decay-skip-adapt` @ e332fef)

## 1 — orientation — started

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:13:00+03:00

- Action: Orientation; target confirmed PR #34 (story 1.2 / CAP-4 latch decay + skip adapt).
- Result: walkthrough-pr-34/ folder unused; ready for narrative draft.
- Evidence: PR #34; story-latch-decay-skip-adapt-plan.md; commit e332fef
- Open: First narrative draft

## 2 — narrative — created

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:14:00+03:00

- Action: Wrote narrative blocks from intent-contract Intent + code map; seeded log; current block Intent.
- Result: walkthrough-pr-34.md ready; no review findings recorded yet; all blocks unchecked.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md; walkthrough-pr-34-log.md; story-latch-decay-skip-adapt-plan.md Intent
- Open: Walk Intent block with user

## 3 — Intent — Thoughts

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:14:00+03:00

- Block: Intent
- Activity: Thoughts (Intent vs PR #34 diff)
- Action: Compared plan Intent Always/Never/matrix to hvac_app.py CAP-4 wiring and tests
- Result: Aligns on skip-adapt-at-start, write-path |u_track| criterion, 0.8 constant, decay commit_omega_c before should_commit else, trip-edge adapt+decay. Finding (open for reviewer): Intent Approach omits sticky latch that holds in (0.8·max, max]; Design Notes + sticky_blow_up_latch implement it — Approach underspecified vs code, not a code defect.
- Evidence: apps/hvac/hvac_app.py L134-161, L215-225, L304-357; story plan Design Notes sticky CAP-4
- Open: User decide Intent done / renegotiate Approach to name sticky / leave as-is

## 4 — Intent — renegotiate Approach

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:15:00+03:00

- Action: Renegotiated Approach + Always to name sticky hold in (0.8·u_track_max, u_track_max]; synced plan intent-contract and narrative.
- Result: Finding from entry 3 closed (fixed in Intent). Code unchanged; Intent now matches sticky_blow_up_latch.
- Evidence: story-latch-decay-skip-adapt-plan.md Intent; walkthrough-pr-34.md Intent
- Open: User accept Intent as done or further polish

## 5 — Intent — Thoughts (renegotiated text)

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:16:00+03:00

- Action: Re-compared renegotiated Approach/Always to sticky_blow_up_latch + decay branch + sticky matrix tests.
- Result: Aligns. sticky = tripped ∨ (latch_in ∧ residue); hold in (0.8·max, max]; clear at ≤0.8; decay gated on sticky ∧ residue. No open Intent findings. Soft note only: "clears only when ≤0.8" omits latch_in=False clear path — not material for CAP-4.
- Evidence: hvac_app.py L154-161, L304-343; test_sticky_blow_up_latch_matrix; test_decay_stops_when_residue_at_or_below_band
- Open: User mark Intent done or polish further

## 6 — Intent — done → Broad strokes

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:17:00+03:00

- Action: User accepted Intent; checked Intent done; advanced to Broad strokes.
- Result: Intent closed after sticky renegotiate. Dirty tree: plan Intent edit + walkthrough-pr-34/ untracked.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md; story-latch-decay-skip-adapt-plan.md
- Open: Broad strokes review; ask user whether to commit dirty walkthrough/plan

## 7 — Broad strokes — Thoughts

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:18:00+03:00

- Action: Checked Broad strokes prose + 5 entry points against hvac_app.py / test layout.
- Result: Order and mechanism accurate. Soft (open): “after write-path tracking” slightly ambiguous (sticky is after write-path guard, before plant write/ESO advance). Soft: test link #L505 is section banner; CAP-6(e) matrices from L540; skip-adapt inspect L369.
- Evidence: hvac_app.py L215-225, L303-343; test_hvac_app.py L369, L506, L540
- Open: User done / polish prose+anchor / ignore soft nits

## 8 — Broad strokes — patch soft nits

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:19:00+03:00

- Action: Patched Broad strokes prose (write-path guard before write/advance) and entry anchors (L134/L215/L304/L334; tests L540/L369/L577).
- Result: Soft findings from entry 7 fixed in narrative. disposition: fixed.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md Broad strokes
- Open: User mark Broad strokes done

## 9 — Broad strokes — done → Decay helpers

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:20:00+03:00

- Action: User accepted Broad strokes; advanced to Decay helpers + sticky latch predicate.
- Result: Broad strokes closed. Still dirty: plan + walkthrough-pr-34/.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md
- Open: Review Decay helpers block

## 10 — Decay helpers — Thoughts

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:20:00+03:00

- Action: Compared four helpers + matrices to renegotiated Intent and guard_u_track latch_out.
- Result: Aligns. Callout (not defect): at |u|==max guard not tripped but residue holds → sticky holds if latch_in. Matrices cover band edges/non-finite/floor. No open findings.
- Evidence: hvac_app.py L74, L134-161; test_hvac_app.py L540-574
- Open: User done / Test matrices / further Thoughts

## 11 — Decay helpers — Test

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:21:00+03:00

- Action: Ran helper unit tests (residue matrix, fraction, next_decayed, sticky matrix).
- Result: 18 passed in 0.27s. Unverified here: control_tick wiring / multi-tick persist (later slices).
- Evidence: `uv run pytest …test_latch_decay_residue_holds_matrix …test_latch_decay_fraction_constant …test_next_decayed_omega_c_step_and_floor …test_sticky_blow_up_latch_matrix -q`
- Open: User mark Decay helpers done

## 12 — Decay helpers — done → Skip-adapt

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:21:00+03:00

- Action: User accepted Decay helpers; advanced to Skip-adapt + sticky latch in control_tick.
- Result: Helpers slice closed after Thoughts+Test.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md
- Open: Review Skip-adapt + sticky wiring block

## 13 — Skip-adapt — Thoughts

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:22:00+03:00

- Action: Traced latch_at_start → zone clear → latch_in → sticky vs Intent Always/Never and inspect tests.
- Result: Aligns. Trip-edge adapt then sticky+decay possible. Soft (accepted as-is unless user reopens): sticky assigned before write; write fail returns without decay — same order as prior latch_out assign.
- Evidence: hvac_app.py L215-309; test_control_tick_skips_maybe_adapt_when_latched_at_start; test_control_tick_wires_should_warn_and_sticky_latch
- Open: User done / Test inspect / reopen soft write-fail ordering

## 14 — Skip-adapt — reopen soft (latch vs write)

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:23:00+03:00

- Action: Reopened soft finding; traced fail-write path vs AI-6 ESO and decay/commit gates.
- Result: Asymmetry confirmed: sticky+WARN run before write; fail returns without ESO reset/advance/decay/commit. Effects: trip+fail → latch True next tick (skip adapt) without plant soft-kill write; clear+fail → latch may clear and re-enable adapt without successful write. Options for user: accept-as-is / defer / move sticky(+WARN?) after successful write.
- Evidence: hvac_app.py L303-321; AI-6 comment L322-324; Intent decay after successful write
- Open: User disposition on soft finding

## 15 — Skip-adapt — patch sticky after write

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:25:00+03:00

- Action: Moved sticky_blow_up_latch after successful _write_setpoint; WARN stays before write; updated inspect test + Intent Approach/Always + Design Notes; refreshed narrative anchors.
- Result: Soft finding fixed. `uv run pytest tests/test_hvac_app.py tests/test_ladrc_tuner.py -q` → 74 passed; ruff clean. disposition: fixed.
- Evidence: hvac_app.py sticky after write; test_control_tick_wires_should_warn_and_sticky_latch; plan Intent
- Open: User confirm Skip-adapt done or re-Test

## 16 — Skip-adapt — Thoughts (post-patch)

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:27:00+03:00

- Action: Re-traced WARN→write→sticky→ESO→advance→decay vs renegotiated Intent.
- Result: Aligns; prior soft closed. Residual (not blocking): fail-write leaves latch unchanged is inspect-ordered only, no behavioral test. No open defects.
- Evidence: hvac_app.py L303-343; test_control_tick_wires_should_warn_and_sticky_latch
- Open: User done / Test / add fail-write behavioral test

## 17 — Skip-adapt — done → Decay commit

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:28:00+03:00

- Action: User accepted Skip-adapt; advanced to Decay commit vs should_commit.
- Result: Skip-adapt closed after sticky-after-write patch. Residual fail-write behavioral test left accepted.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md
- Open: Review Decay commit block

## 18 — Decay commit — Thoughts

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:28:00+03:00

- Action: Compared decay if/else to Intent; trip-edge + mirror persist tests.
- Result: Aligns — decay XOR should_commit; trip does not block decay persist; step from committed ωc. Soft residual (accepted unless reopened): mirror omits write-fail gate post sticky-after-write patch.
- Evidence: hvac_app.py L333-357; test_trip_edge_decay_persists_despite_guard_trip; _mirror_decay_tick
- Open: User done / Test persist / reopen mirror gap

## 19 — Decay commit — reopen mirror gap

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:29:00+03:00

- Action: Reopened `_mirror_decay_tick` vs post-patch control_tick write gate.
- Result: Mirror always sticky+decay; production fail-write returns with latch/ωc unchanged. Options: accept (mirror=success path only) / defer / patch mirror with write_ok=False case + test.
- Evidence: test_hvac_app.py L576-605; hvac_app.py L313-343
- Open: User disposition

## 20 — Decay commit — patch mirror write_ok

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:30:00+03:00

- Action: Added write_ok to _mirror_decay_tick; test_fail_write_leaves_latch_and_omega_c_unchanged (latched gray-band + trip-edge fail).
- Result: Soft fixed. 75 passed; ruff clean. disposition: fixed.
- Evidence: test_hvac_app.py _mirror_decay_tick; test_fail_write_leaves_latch_and_omega_c_unchanged
- Open: User mark Decay commit done or re-Thoughts/Test

## 21 — Decay commit — Thoughts (post mirror patch)

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:31:00+03:00

- Result: Aligns. Fail-write locked behaviorally; success-path persist tests unchanged. No open findings.
- Evidence: _mirror_decay_tick; test_fail_write_leaves_latch_and_omega_c_unchanged; hvac_app.py L333-357
- Open: User mark Decay commit done

## 22 — Decay commit — done → Tests

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:31:00+03:00

- Action: User accepted Decay commit; advanced to Tests / CAP-6(e) locks.
- Result: Decay slice closed after write_ok mirror patch.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md
- Open: Review Tests block

## 23 — Tests — Thoughts

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:32:00+03:00

- Action: Mapped Intent I/O matrix to CAP-6(e) tests + walkthrough fail-write lock.
- Result: All matrix rows have a lock. Soft residuals (not defects unless reopened): skip-adapt inspect-only; latched-at-start+residue-OK split across inspect+band-stop; no live AD control_tick.
- Evidence: test_hvac_app.py CAP-4 section; Intent matrix
- Open: User done / Test suite / reopen residuals

## 24 — Tests — reopen residuals

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:33:00+03:00

- Action: Reopened three soft residuals from entry 23 for disposition.
- Result: R1 skip-adapt inspect-only; R2 latched-at-start+band-OK not combined; R3 no live AppDaemon. Options per residual: accept / defer / patch.
- Evidence: test_control_tick_skips_maybe_adapt_when_latched_at_start; test_decay_stops_when_residue_at_or_below_band; plan Auto Run residual risks
- Open: User disposition per residual or batch

## 25 — Tests — accept all residuals

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:35:00+03:00

- Action: User chose batch accept all (option 1) for R1–R3.
- Result: R1 skip-adapt inspect-only, R2 split latched+band-OK, R3 no live AD — disposition accepted as-is (entry-1 posture). No code change.
- Evidence: walkthrough session choice 1
- Open: User mark Tests done or run Test suite

## 26 — Tests — Thoughts (post-accept)

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:35:00+03:00

- Action: Re-reviewed Tests block after accept-all residuals.
- Result: No new findings. CAP-6(e) + walkthrough fail-write/sticky-after-write locks sufficient for story close posture.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md Tests notes; test_hvac_app.py CAP-4 section
- Open: User mark Tests done or Test suite

## 27 — Tests — Test suite

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:36:00+03:00

- Action: Ran full hvac_app + ladrc_tuner suite and ruff on touched files.
- Result: 75 passed in 0.37s; ruff clean. Unverified: live AppDaemon (R3 accepted).
- Evidence: `uv run pytest tests/test_hvac_app.py tests/test_ladrc_tuner.py -q`; `uv run ruff check apps/hvac/hvac_app.py tests/test_hvac_app.py`
- Open: User mark Tests done

## 28 — Tests — done → Periphery

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:36:00+03:00

- Action: User accepted Tests; advanced to Periphery.
- Result: Tests closed after 75-pass suite + accept residuals.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-34.md
- Open: Review Periphery; dirty tree with walkthrough patches not yet on PR

## 29 — Periphery — Thoughts

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:37:00+03:00

- Action: Checked plan/PR/CI/deferred-work vs renegotiated Intent and companions.
- Result: CI pass on published head only. Soft: CAP-4 companion lag (sticky, sticky-after-write) — propose defer to CAP-5 like PR#31 CAP-2. Must push walkthrough patches. No code defect in periphery itself.
- Evidence: deferred-work.md; control-tick-behaviors.md CAP-4; git status; gh pr checks 34
- Open: User done / defer companion / commit now

## 30 — Periphery — defer CAP-4 companion

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:38:00+03:00

- Action: Appended deferred-work.md entry for CAP-4 companion sticky + sticky-after-write sync (CAP-5).
- Result: Companion lag disposition deferred. Still need commit/push of walkthrough code+docs before merge.
- Evidence: deferred-work.md PR #34 section; walkthrough-pr-34.md Periphery notes
- Open: User mark Periphery done → wrap-up

## 31 — Periphery — done → wrap-up

Session: unavailable · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T04:38:00+03:00
