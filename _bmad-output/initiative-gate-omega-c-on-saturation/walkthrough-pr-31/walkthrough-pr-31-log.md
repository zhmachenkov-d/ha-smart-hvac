Target: https://github.com/zhmachenkov-d/ha-smart-hvac/pull/31 (`feat/directional-clamp-strict-apply` @ 2868763)

## 1 — orientation — started

Session: 8d2a06f4-213c-4bc6-8b9b-5d455d0edc8a · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T03:13:00+03:00

- Action: Orientation; target confirmed PR #31.
- Result: walkthrough-pr-31/ ready; waiting on narrative draft.
- Evidence: PR #31; story-directional-clamp-strict-apply-plan.md
- Open: First narrative draft

## 2 — narrative — created

Session: 8d2a06f4-213c-4bc6-8b9b-5d455d0edc8a · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T03:14:30+03:00

- Action: Wrote full narrative blocks from frozen Intent + code map; current block Intent.
- Result: Narrative ready; no findings yet.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-31.md; story-directional-clamp-strict-apply-plan.md Intent; PR #31
- Open: Walk Intent block with user

## 3 — Intent — Thoughts

Session: 8d2a06f4-213c-4bc6-8b9b-5d455d0edc8a · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T03:15:30+03:00

- Action: Compared frozen Intent to CAP-1/2, architecture flowchart, control-tick-behaviors.
- Result: Intent aligns with CAP-1+CAP-2 goals and story scope (CAP-6 a/b only). Known tension: companion CAP-2 literal forbids any with_omega_c(proposed) for compute_tracking; Intent Approach allows provisional apply-signal and names write-path — accepted plan decision, not Intent defect. CAP-3/4 still in arch diagram but correctly Never/later.
- Evidence: story-directional-clamp-strict-apply-plan.md Intent; control-tick-behaviors.md CAP-1/2; architecture-diagrams.md
- Open: User accept/reject Intent block

## 4 — Intent — renegotiate wording

Session: 8d2a06f4-213c-4bc6-8b9b-5d455d0edc8a · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T03:17:30+03:00

- Action: Human chose option 2; updated frozen Intent in plan + narrative.
- Result: Approach/Always/matrix Max+ωc↑ clarified; companion CAP-2 not synced.
- Evidence: story-directional-clamp-strict-apply-plan.md; walkthrough-pr-31.md
- Open: Accept Intent block; dirty tree (plan+narrative)

## 5 — Intent — Thoughts (after renegotiate)

Session: 8d2a06f4-213c-4bc6-8b9b-5d455d0edc8a · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T03:19:30+03:00

- Action: Re-read renegotiated Intent vs CAP/arch.
- Result: Main CAP-2 tension closed in Intent; residual: Always cites arch diagram that omits provisional; Min+ωc↓ matrix lacks write-path adjective; companion CAP-2/arch still stale (deferred).
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-31.md Intent; architecture-diagrams.md; control-tick-behaviors.md CAP-2
- Open: Accept Intent or polish residual wording

## 6 — Intent — polish 1–2

Session: 8d2a06f4-213c-4bc6-8b9b-5d455d0edc8a · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T03:22:30+03:00

- Result: Residual wording 1–2 closed in Intent.

- Open: Accept Intent block

- Action: Reviewed Broad strokes entry map vs control_tick/helper.
- Result: Map OK; blurb provisional note already present from entry 7 tweak — Thoughts cosmetic #1 closed. No code findings.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-31.md Broad strokes; hvac_app.py:112-130,:201-302
- Open: Accept Broad strokes

## 9 — Broad strokes — Test

Session: 8d2a06f4-213c-4bc6-8b9b-5d455d0edc8a · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T03:25:30+03:00

- Action: Compared should_commit_omega_c to CAP-1 and matrix tests.
- Result: Predicate matches CAP-1 (>= max / <= min). No logic bug. Nits: name used for apply+commit; proposed==current not in matrix (allows, harmless).
- Evidence: hvac_app.py:112-130; test_hvac_app.py matrix; control-tick-behaviors CAP-1
- Open: Accept Directional helper

- Action: Traced provisional/final/reuse/omega_to_commit vs Design Notes.
- Result: Matches plan. No-resurrect via omega_to_commit=None verified. Latch/WARN after write-chosen guard only. Zone reset at most once. Nits: post-write helper redundant when apply_true; duplicated track+guard branches.
