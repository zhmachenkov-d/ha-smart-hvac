# Review log: PR #43

Target: https://github.com/zhmachenkov-d/ha-smart-hvac/pull/43 (`test/omega-c-deferred-stub-locks` @ 22482cb)

## 1 — orientation — started

Session: 69535401-c457-4276-a2d9-0fe6ef311564 · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T14:32:00+03:00

- Action: Orientation; proposed target PR #43 (Package C deferred stub locks).
- Result: User approved target.
- Evidence: PR #43; plan-package-c-deferred-stub-locks.md; commit 22482cb
- Open: Draft narrative

## 2 — narrative — drafted

Session: 69535401-c457-4276-a2d9-0fe6ef311564 · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T14:34:00+03:00

- Action: Wrote narrative skeleton; Intent pasted verbatim from frozen plan; other blocks placeholders.
- Result: Current block Intent in progress; awaiting human review moves.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-43.md; plan frozen Intent
- Open: none

## 3 — Intent — Thoughts

Session: 69535401-c457-4276-a2d9-0fe6ef311564 · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T14:35:00+03:00

- Action: Compared frozen Intent + R1–R3 to PR #43 diff (plan + two tests); checked deferred-work still lists both Q5 items.
- Result: Diff matches Intent — tests-only, both named locks, R1 clamp(u_ff)=49.0, R3 ≥3 strict + JSON/reload, no production edits. Soft note: deferred-work.md not updated (plan Never allows; separate deferred bullet). No Intent gaps vs code.
- Evidence: tests/test_hvac_app.py:1107-1173; plan Intent; deferred-work.md Q5 bullets; gh pr diff 43 (no apps/)
- Open: await user done/next on Intent

## 4 — Intent — done

- Action: User accepted Intent block.
- Result: Intent done; advancing to Broad strokes.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-43.md
- Open: Broad strokes review; walkthrough-pr-43/ untracked — ask commit?

## 5 — Broad strokes — Thoughts

Session: 69535401-c457-4276-a2d9-0fe6ef311564 · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T14:37:00+03:00

- Action: Checked five Broad strokes entry points against PR diff and production seams they lock.
- Result: Five points are enough — both tests, _tick_app, sticky+decay, equality skip. Soft: mirrors / CAP-6(c) unit locks correctly out of Broad strokes (later slice or periphery). No gap vs Intent.
- Evidence: test_hvac_app.py:807,1107,1133; hvac_app.py:299-329,440; mirrors ~606
- Open: await user done/next on Broad strokes

## 6 — Broad strokes — done

- Action: User accepted Broad strokes.
- Result: Advancing to Multi-tick latched decay persist slice.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-43.md
- Open: Multi-tick review; walkthrough-pr-43/ still untracked

## 7 — Multi-tick — Thoughts

Session: 69535401-c457-4276-a2d9-0fe6ef311564 · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T14:38:00+03:00

- Action: Compared multi-tick Hass lock to R3, skip-adapt→sticky→decay path, and mirror floor ownership.
- Result: Matches R3 (≥3 strict + JSON/reload); default plant 45≠49 so writes succeed each tick (sticky-after-write). Soft: no exact next_decayed step assert (Intent thinner-than-mirrors). Soft: skip-adapt not asserted directly — implied by decay-only decreases. No findings.
- Evidence: test_hvac_app.py:1107-1130; hvac_app.py:217-221,300-329; mirror:607
- Open: await user done/next

## 8 — Multi-tick — Test

- Action: Ran Hass multi-tick lock + mirror floor test.
- Result: Both passed (2 in 0.28s). Unverified here: equal-value lock, full test_hvac_app.py suite.
- Evidence: `uv run pytest …::test_control_tick_multi_tick_latched_decay_persists …::test_multi_tick_decay_persists_until_omega_c_min -q`
- Open: await user done/next

## 9 — Multi-tick — done

- Action: User accepted Multi-tick block.
- Result: Advancing to Equal-value write-on-change side effects.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-43.md
- Open: Equal-value review

## 10 — Equal-value — Thoughts

Session: 69535401-c457-4276-a2d9-0fe6ef311564 · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T14:39:30+03:00

- Action: Compared equal-value Hass lock to R1, equality-success → sticky+decay, and CAP-6(c) unit companion.
- Result: R1 clamp(u_ff)=49.0 correct; latch starts False so sticky-after-True-write is proven; exact one next_decayed step. Soft: filters only number/set_value (plan). Soft: adapt apply=False so decay baseline = omega_before. No findings.
- Evidence: test_hvac_app.py:1133-1173; hvac_app.py:65-66,440-441,300-329; unit:1193

- Action: Ran Hass equal-value lock + CAP-6(c) unit equality skip (parametrized).
- Result: 4 passed in 0.29s. Unverified here: full test_hvac_app.py suite.
- Evidence: `uv run pytest …::test_control_tick_equal_setpoint_skips_set_value_still_sticky_decays …::test_write_setpoint_skips_set_value_when_entity_float_equals -q`

- Action: User accepted Equal-value block.
- Result: Advancing to Periphery.
- Evidence: walkthrough-pr-43.md
- Open: Periphery review

## 13 — Periphery — Thoughts

Session: 69535401-c457-4276-a2d9-0fe6ef311564 · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T14:41:00+03:00

- Action: Checked periphery items vs plan Never and PR file list / CI.
- Result: Plan+import correctly in PR; deferred-work Q5 still open by design; no ADR/apps/CI config in diff. Soft: wrap-up may clear deferred Q5 + commit walkthrough. Soft: CI status separate from periphery content.
- Evidence: deferred-work.md; plan status built; gh pr files (plan + tests only)
- Open: await user done/next

## 14 — Periphery — Test

Session: 69535401-c457-4276-a2d9-0fe6ef311564 · Timestamp: 2026-10-17T14:41:30+03:00

- Action: Full `test_hvac_app.py` + ruff on that file.
- Result: 75 passed; ruff clean. Matches plan Verification / PR test plan.
- Evidence: `uv run pytest tests/test_hvac_app.py -q`; `uv run ruff check tests/test_hvac_app.py`
- Open: await user done/next
