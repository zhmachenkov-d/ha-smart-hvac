## Status

Ingested (first pass) — [MADRC](/concepts/madrc.md) idea, tuning/adaptation rules, and field outcomes extracted; SST transfer-function tables left in the PDF.

## What the paper does

Controls **superheated steam temperature (SST)** on a thermal power unit with a **cascade** structure: inner-loop proportional (on-site: PI noted in conclusions) on the leading zone; outer-loop **[MADRC](/concepts/madrc.md)** on the inert zone. MADRC adds an inertia compensation block \(G_{cp}(s)=1/(Ts+1)^{n-1}\) so the [ESO](/concepts/extended-state-observer.md) sees a delayed command \(u_f\) matched to the delayed measurement \(y\).

Plant models at 100% / 75% / 50% load are high-order inertias \(K/(Ts+1)^n\) (Table 1 in PDF). Fixed-parameter MADRC is extended with **linear gain scheduling** of controller gain \(k_p\) and compensation time constant \(T\) vs unit load \(P\); \(b_0\) and \(\omega_o\) are held fixed (\(b_0=0.06\), \(\omega_o=0.3\) in their sims) because changing \(b_0\) jumps the control law.

Compared in simulation to integral-gain-adaptive PID, fruit-fly-tuned second-order ADRC, and nonlinear ADRC (NLADRC): setpoint + step/ramp/sine disturbances; Monte Carlo ±10% parameter uncertainty; \(M_s\) robustness; high-frequency noise on the TDOF equivalent.

**Field (660 MW supercritical unit, DCS, 250 ms sample):** after deployment, A/B-side SST fluctuation range fell to **34.0% / 53.0%** of baseline; fluctuation variance to **28.5% / 43.3%** (Table 5 / abstract).

## Tuning rules (their plant)

1. Fix \(b_0 \in [K/(2T),\infty)\).
2. Start small \(k_p\), \(\omega_o\); raise \(\omega_o\) until output barely changes; they settle near \(\omega_o \in [0.3,0.6]\).
3. Raise \(k_p\) for tracking; schedule \(k_p\) (and \(T\)) across load points — **not** \(b_0\).

Treat numbers as **literature examples**, not OpenTherm HVAC settings.

## Fit to this project

Prior art for **large-inertia temperature loops** and for **adapting ADRC gains across operating regimes**. Not a drop-in blueprint:

| This paper | This repo |
|------------|-----------|
| Attemperation water valve → steam temperature | OpenTherm [Set Water Temperature](/concepts/set-water-temperature.md) → zone/plant water |
| Cascade leading + inert zones of a superheater | Single [Plant](/concepts/plant.md) + [Zones](/concepts/zone.md); coordinator role open |
| Schedule vs **electrical load** | Possible analogue: outdoor temp / demand level — **not decided** |

## Key sections (PDF)

1. Introduction — SST under deep peak shaving; ADRC variants; MADRC motivation
2. SST structure & multi-load models (Table 1)
3. First-order ADRC → MADRC compensation → tuning flowchart → adaptive \(k_p\)
4. Simulations: nominal, Monte Carlo, \(M_s\), noise (TDOF form)
5. Field application on 660 MW unit (Eqs. 29–30 scheduling)
6. Conclusions
