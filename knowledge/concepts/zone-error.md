# Zone Error

**Zone Error** is, per thermostat in a [Zone](/concepts/zone.md): setpoint minus zone sensor temperature. Zone-level error is the **maximum** across thermostats in that Zone. The [Critical Zone](/concepts/critical-zone.md) is the Zone with the largest positive Zone Error in a control step.

Use **Heating Demand** when a Zone needs heat (zone error > 0). Avoid “delta” (ambiguous).
